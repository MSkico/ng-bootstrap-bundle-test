## Trying to bundle only submodules of ng-bootstrap

[SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67077928/importing-ng-bootstrap-submodule-includes-entire-ng-bootstrap-in-bundle)

The bundle analysis (see script `analyze` in `package.json`) shows that the entire ng-bootstrap module is included (ng-bootstrap.js, 442kB stat size).
